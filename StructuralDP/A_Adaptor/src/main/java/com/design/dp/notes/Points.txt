The adapter design pattern is one of the structural design patterns and is used so that two unrelated interfaces
can work together. The object that joins these unrelated interfaces is called an adapter.


While implementing Adapter pattern, there are two approaches - class adapter and object adapter -
 however both these approaches produce same result.

1. Class Adapter - This form uses java inheritance and extends the source interface, in our case Socket class.
2. Object Adapter - This form uses Java Composition and adapter contains the source object.
